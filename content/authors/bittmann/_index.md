Since September 2021, I am a research associate at the [University of Edinburgh](https://hodge.maths.ed.ac.uk/tiki/Welcome). Before that, I was working at the [University of Vienna](https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/en/). 

I completed my PhD at the [Université Paris Diderot](https://u-paris.fr/en/), under the supervision of [David Hernandez](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~david.hernandez/), in 2019.
