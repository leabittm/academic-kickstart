I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of mathematics of the University of Vienna, in the team of [Anton Mellit](https://mellit.org/).

I did my PhD at the Université Paris Diderot, under the supervision of [David Hernandez](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~david.hernandez/). I defended in July 2019, the manuscript can be found [here](http://www.normalesup.org/~lbittmann/files/these.pdf).
